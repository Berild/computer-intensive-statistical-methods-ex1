\paragraph{1.}
We consider a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ and $\beta = 1$, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f}
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\G(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} \e^{-x}, & 0 < x, \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%

\paragraph{(a)}
We wish to generate samples from the distribution given in equation~\eqref{eq:f} using rejection sampling with $g(x)$ (see equation~\eqref{eq:g}) as proposal density. We need to find $k \geq 1$ s.t. $f(x) \leq k \cdot g(x)$. In addition to the trivial case $x \leq 0$ (where $f(x) = g(x) = 0$, there are two cases:
%
\begin{align*}
    0 < x < 1: & \quad \frac{\e^{-x}}{\Gamma(\alpha)c} \leq \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)c} = \frac{\e + \alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)e} \leq k \\
    x \geq 1: & \quad \frac{x^{\alpha - 1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)c} \leq \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)c} = \frac{\e + \alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)e} \leq k \, ,
\end{align*}
%
where $c = \e\alpha/(\e + \alpha)$, as before. We set $k$ as small as possible to maximize the acceptance probability $k^{-1}$, i.e. $k = [\Gamma(\alpha)c]^{-1}$.
